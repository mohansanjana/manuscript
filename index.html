            <p>How people respond to colour is of great interest to those who work in marketing. Colour psychology research is often focused on how the colour of a logo or a product will yield higher sales, and what colour preferences can be found in certain age groups and cultures. The study of the psychological effects of colour have coincided with colour theory in general. Goethe focused on the experience of colour in his Zur farbenlehre from 1810,1 in opposition to Sir Isaac Newton's rational approach.</p>

            <h3>GOETHE AND SCHILLER COUPLED COLOURS TO CHARACTER TRAITS: RED FOR BEAUTIFUL, YELLOW FOR GOOD, GREEN FOR USEFUL AND BLUE FOR COMMON.</h3>

            <p><em><strong>Gestalt psychology in the early 1900s also attributed universal emotions to colours, a theory that was taught to students at the Bauhaus by Wassily Kandinsky.</em></strong></p>

            <p>The best known colour psychology test was conducted by Max LÃ¼scher in the 1940s, when he tested the responses of people to a series of coloured cards. A psychologist could interpret the person's character based on the test results. The interpretation of this research in colour psychology is disputed, since it is not clear whether people respond to the colours or the cultural concept of the colour. It is more likely that the cultural context, our upbringing, and personal preferences influence our interpretation of colour more than anything else. 2 Some colour psychology findings have been proven to work. 'Cooler' colours can have a calming influence on people, which is why hospitals and prison walls are often painted in a soft greenish colour. Another research shows that the colour of placebo pills influences their effectiveness. Blue coloured pills work better as depressants, and red colour pills better as stimulants.</p>

            <h2>Color & Culture</h2>
           
            <h3>RESEARCH SHOWS THAT <strong>NINETY EIGHT LANGUAGES</strong> HAVE WORDS FOR THE SAME BASIC ELEVEN COLORS. </h3>
            
            <p>however, the meaning a colour may have can be very different. There are conflicting theories on whether the cultural meanings of colours can be categorised. Meanings can change over time and depend on the context. Black may be the colour of mourning in many countries, though a black book cover or a black poster is not always associated with death. Another example is that brides in China traditionally wear red, but many brides have started to wear white in recent decades.<em><strong>The cultural meaning of colours is not set but always changing.</strong></em> The next few pages list some of the meanings of colours in different cultures.</p>
    
            <h2>black .</h2>

During the Middle Ages, <em><strong>black clothing</strong></em> became popular, and during the Renaissance it was worn by the wealthy and nobility in all parts of Europe. In the nineteenth century, the black army was the nickname of the Russian anarchists. In the twentieth century, black became the colour of Italian and German fascism, who were called blackshirts. In Shia Islam black is a very devout colour. The black standard is one of the flags of Muhammad in Islam. The black standard has been appropriated as a symbol by jihadism since the late 1990s.</p>

            <h2>yellow .</h2>

In East Asia, yellow is considered <em><strong>sacred and imperial</strong></em>. In China it is the colour for <em><strong>royalty</strong></em>, and during the Qing Dynasty, only members of the imperial household were permitted to wear yellow. In China it is still seen as the colour of <em><strong>happiness, glory, wisdom, harmony, and culture</strong></em>. Yellow is used to <em><strong>symbolise gold</strong></em> as one of the colours of the Catholic church and the Vatican. Yellow in Italian is giallo and a nickname for crime stories.

Green is the traditional colour of <em><strong> Islam </strong></em>, the colour of the prophet Muhammed, which is why many flags in the Islamic world use the colour green. Since the 1980s, green has become the colour of <em><strong>environmental parties</strong></em> and organisations. Green parties in Europe have programmes based on ecology and environment. The word greenwashing is used to describe the advertising of companies that use <em><strong>positive environmental practices</strong></em> to cover up environmentally unfriendly activities. A <em><strong>'green room'</strong></em> is used in television and theatre to quiet nervous performers.</p>
    
            <h2>blue .</h2>
   
            <p>is tested as the colour that is <em><strong>best liked by all cultures</strong></em>, which is how it became the colour for <em><strong>international business</strong></em>. The United Nations chose blue as a colour in 1946, but the colour has no special significance. <em><strong>Bluewashing</strong></em> is a term for companies that join the United Nations 'Global Impact Initiative' only for PR reasons. <em><strong>'Blue collar worker'</strong></em> refers to the shirts worn by people working manual labour jobs. The Tuareg of North Africa wear blue turbans, dyed with indigo. <em><strong>Azure blue is the national colour of Italy</strong></em>, the national soccer team is called the Azzurri.

In Western politics the colour purple is neutral, and used for a coalition between a left-wing and a right-wing party. <em><strong>The Women's Suffrage movement</strong></em> used purple, and the colour was adopted in the 1970s by the women's liberation movement. Purple and pink are both associated with the <em><strong>LGBT community</strong></em>. </p>

            <h2>National Colours</h2>
    
            <p>With <em>Yuri Veerman</em></p>

            <p>The flag has been the most prominent symbol of national identity since the nineteenth century. A new national flag often marks a revolution or a political change. Flags have a military origin, and were used to identify military units from one another in the Roman legions. Different national flags often use similar colours, sometimes even with the same meaning. </p>

            <h3>THIRTY-EIGHT PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S NATIONAL FLAGS USE RED AS A COLOUR WHICH SYMBOLISES THE BOOL SPILT FOR <strong>INDEPENDENCE</strong>, OR ON THE BATTLEFIELD.</h3>
       
            <p>One of the most used colour combinations is red, white, and blue (Chile, Panama, Russia, Samoa, United Kingdom, Thailand, etc.) where blue often symbolises the domination over sky or sea. Many African countries use red, black, and green in their flags. This stems from the Pan-African flag from 1920.The red symbolises the blood spilled for liberation, black is for the African people, and green for the continent's natural wealth.</p>
       
            <p>The green flag was a personal choice of Muammar Gaddafi whose manifesto was called the 'Green Book'. </p>
       
            <h4>Artist Yuri Veerman collected the different digital versions of the Libyan flag that were discussed on the English Wikipedia page, <strong>'Flag of Libya'</strong>.</h4>
        
            <p>Between 2005 and 2011 the chromatic representation of Libya was revised fifteen times, each with different shade of green. After a six-year fight over the right shade of 'Gadaffi green', a fifteenth revision was made, marking the fall of the Libyan regime and the last monochrome flag. </p>
